# Seasons & Stars

A calendar and timekeeping module for Foundry VTT v13+ with clean integration APIs and extensible architecture.

## 🌟 Features

### ✅ **Available Now (Alpha)**

- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive calendar interface with ApplicationV2 architecture
- **Multiple Calendar Views**: Full calendar widget, compact mini widget, and monthly grid view
- **Configurable Quick Time Buttons**: Customizable time advancement buttons with live preview and smart mini widget selection
- **Smart Year Navigation**: Click year to jump instantly instead of clicking arrows repeatedly
- **Convenient Defaults**: Gregorian calendars can initialize with current date/time
- **Module Integration**: Clean APIs for weather modules and other integrations via compatibility bridges
- **SmallTime Integration**: Seamless positioning and visual consistency with enhanced styling
- **15 Built-in Calendars**: Switch between Gregorian, fantasy calendars (D&D, PF2e, Critical Role, etc.), and custom formats based on official game sources

### ✅ **Notes System (Basic Creation)**

- **Note Creation**: Functional note creation interface via calendar grid (GMs only - click plus button)
- **Visual Indicators**: Calendar shows colored borders for days with notes
- **Backend API**: CRUD operations available for module developers (note editing via API, not UI)
- **Simple Calendar Compatibility**: API compatibility via separate compatibility bridge module

⚠️ **Current Limitations**:

- **Note Editing**: While notes can be created with calendar-specific metadata (categories, tags, dates), editing only opens the basic Foundry journal interface which **cannot modify calendar-specific fields**
- **Metadata Management**: Tags, categories, and date associations cannot be changed after creation
- **Limited UI**: No dedicated note management interface - relies on basic Foundry journal sheets

### 🚧 **Coming Soon**

- **Complete Notes UI**: Note viewing, editing, and management interface
- **Calendar Import/Creation**: In-app calendar editor and Simple Calendar migration tools
- **Advanced Configuration**: Enhanced calendar customization and validation
- **Extended Integrations**: Additional module compatibility and hook enhancements

## 🎯 Who Should Use This

### **Beta Testers**

- Module developers wanting to integrate calendar functionality
- GMs who need reliable timekeeping with clean UI
- Communities wanting to test cutting-edge calendar features

### **Migration Candidates**

- Users seeking a calendar solution built for Foundry v13+
- Users wanting enhanced SmallTime integration
- Communities needing custom calendar support

⚠️ **Migration Note**: Simple Calendar users should review [Known Issues](./KNOWN-ISSUES.md) for current migration limitations. Calendar import tools are planned for v0.3.0 to address the primary migration barrier.

## 🤝 Module Integration

Seasons & Stars provides **clean integration APIs** for calendar-aware modules:

```javascript
// Direct API access
const currentDate = game.seasonsStars.api.getCurrentDate();
const worldTime = game.seasonsStars.api.dateToWorldTime(currentDate);
const formatted = game.seasonsStars.api.formatDate(currentDate);

// Hook integration for module updates
Hooks.on('seasons-stars:dateChanged', data => {
  // Respond to date changes in your module
  console.log('Date changed:', data.newDate);
});
```

**Compatibility bridges available** for seamless migration from other calendar systems.

## 📋 Requirements

- **Foundry VTT**: v13 or higher
- **Compatibility**: Intended for all game systems (system-agnostic design)
- **Permissions**: GM required for time changes

## 🔧 Development

### For Module Developers

```javascript
// Access the Seasons & Stars API
const currentDate = game.seasonsStars.api.getCurrentDate();
await game.seasonsStars.api.advanceDays(1);

// Listen for date changes
Hooks.on('seasons-stars:dateChanged', data => {
  console.log('Date changed:', data.newDate);
});
```
