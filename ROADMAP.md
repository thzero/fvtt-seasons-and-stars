# Seasons & Stars Development Roadmap

> **The future of calendar and timekeeping for Foundry VTT**

This roadmap outlines planned features and development priorities for Seasons & Stars. As an alpha project, timelines are estimates based on community feedback and development capacity.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Seasons & Stars aims to provide a **modern, reliable, and extensible** calendar solution for Foundry VTT with:

- Clean, intuitive user interface built for Foundry v13+
- Comprehensive Simple Calendar compatibility for existing modules
- Rich calendar format supporting diverse fantasy settings
- Performance-optimized architecture for large campaigns

## 📋 Current Status: v0.2.2 Alpha Release

**What's Working Now:**

- ✅ **Core Calendar System**: Date calculations, multiple calendars, Foundry time integration
- ✅ **Modern UI**: Calendar widget, mini widget, grid view, calendar selection
- ✅ **12 Built-in Calendars**: Gregorian, D&D settings, PF2e Golarion, Critical Role, and more
- ✅ **Simple Calendar Compatibility**: API compatibility via separate bridge module
- ✅ **SmallTime Integration**: Auto-positioning and visual consistency
- ✅ **Notes System**: Backend API complete with full creation UI (categories, tags, recurring events)
- ⚠️ **Notes Editing**: Limited to basic Foundry journal interface - calendar metadata cannot be modified after creation
- 🧪 **Error Reporting**: Optional Errors and Echoes integration (when module available)
- 🧪 **Memory Integration**: Optional Memory Mage integration (pre-release development module)

**Testing Status:**

- 🧪 **Alpha Quality**: Core calendar features tested and functional
- ⚠️ **Notes System**: Creation UI functional, but editing requires calendar-aware interface for metadata management
- 📊 **Test Coverage**: 63/63 automated tests passing (~11% overall coverage - primarily calendar engine and basic widget functionality)
- 🔍 **Seeking Feedback**: User testing and bug reports welcome, especially for notes system
- ⚠️ **Known Limitations**: See [Known Issues](KNOWN-ISSUES.md) for current limitations
